        <p style="text-align:center ; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" > <i> Mountains are really very beautiful and refreshing landscape to look at.<br> Speaking in the geographical terms, mountains are highly elevated part of land.<br>
            They attain greater height as compared to surrounding land.<br> Mountains are one of the most prominent feature of the Earth’s landscape.<br>
            They symbolize perfection, success, strength and many other positive traits.<br> The highest tip of the mountain is called it’s ‘Peak’.<br>         
            Although there are other elevated land forms also like, Plateau, Cliff, Hills etc.<br> but the height of mountain is greatest of all.<br> The height of the mountain is calculated on the basis of mean sea level on Earth.<br>             
            Although there is no commonly agreed average height, above which an elevation can be considered a mountain.<br> But in general terms, an elevation above 1,000 meters from the mean sea level can be considered as a mountain.<br>  
            When there are several mountain in continuation, they form a ‘Mountain Chain’.<br> And when these Mountain Chains run parallel to each other, they are called a ‘Mountain Range’.<br>
            Being at the great heights, most of the mountains are covered with the thick layer of snow throughout the year. <br>And this scenic & serene natural beauty provides good opportunity<br> of recreation also, to the tourists.          
            Mountains generally have a broader base, while their top are narrower.<br> At different altitudes of a mountain, different types floral & faunal species are found. Alpine and Coniferous<br> forests are found at the mountains.  
            Mountains add up tremendous beauty to the surrounding landscape, as the great Himalayas does to the north Indian landscape of our country.<br> And the Alps does to the European landscape, e<br>tc. </p></em>
